## ðŸš€ About project

Here is a demo: 

The design comes from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

The whole page was fully impelented with DatoCMS. Every page is there
Main page, about page, location page and contanct page are static 
For portfolio pages I made a template. Moreover the template was made also for "normal page" if there is need to create such one.

Styling: Styled components 
Components: To mange components I tried atomic approach (my first time)
