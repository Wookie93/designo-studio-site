## ðŸš€ About project

Here is a demo: https://dulcet-arithmetic-888891.netlify.app

The design comes from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

The whole page was fully impelented with DatoCMS.

Main page, about page, location page and contanct page are static - have their own template 
For portfolio pages I created one template
Moreover the template was made also for "normal page" if there is need to create such one.

I also implemented Formik for contact form

Styling: Styled components 
Components: To mange components I tried atomic approach (my first time)
